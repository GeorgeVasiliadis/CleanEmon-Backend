def quantize_by_time(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Accepts a dataframe indexed by non-continuous datetime objects and returns a fully continuous dataframe.

    _Continuous_ refers to the series that has no gaps. Not to be confused with _continuous/discrete_ terms.

    Example:
    Say that INTERVAL=5. That means that every 5 seconds a new sample enters your dataframe. Ideally, by the end of the
    day you would have a dataframe with 17280 sample. This would look like so:
    -------Dataframe1------------
    00:00:00    values_0
    00:00:05    values_1
    00:00:10    values_2
    ...         ...
    23:59:45    values_17277
    23:59:50    values_17278
    23:59:50    values_17279
    -----------------------------

    Note that the values range from 0 up to 17279 (17280 in total). This is a fully continuous day, because no
    timeslots were missed.

    However, it is quite possible that your sampling system is not precise enough and some samples would fall out of
    that quantized pattern. The following dataframe is more likely to occur:
    -------Dataframe2------------
    00:00:03    values_0
    00:00:08    values_1
    00:00:12    values_2
    ...         ...
    23:59:45    values_17201
    23:59:49    values_17202
    23:59:57    values_17203
    -----------------------------

    Note that both indexes are not quantized (they don't repeat each 5 seconds) and the total number of samples is not
    17280, as some of them are never captured.

    This function would map Dataframe2 to Dataframe1. The workflow consists of those steps:
        1. Round each timestamp to its closest quantum
        2. If more than one original samples map to the same quantum, keep only one of them
        3. Quantum with no value still get to stay in their position even they may be empty (no sample mapped to them)
